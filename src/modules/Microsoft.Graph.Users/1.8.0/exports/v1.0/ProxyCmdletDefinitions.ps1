    [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
    [Pattern <IMicrosoftGraphRecurrencePattern>]: recurrencePattern
      [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      [DayOfMonth <Int32?>]: The day of the month on which the event occurs. Required if type is absoluteMonthly or absoluteYearly.
      [DaysOfWeek <String[]>]: A collection of the days of the week on which the event occurs. The possible values are: sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday. If type is relativeMonthly or relativeYearly, and daysOfWeek specifies more than one day, the event falls on the first day that satisfies the pattern.  Required if type is weekly, relativeMonthly, or relativeYearly.
      [FirstDayOfWeek <String>]: dayOfWeek
      [Index <String>]: weekIndex
      [Interval <Int32?>]: The number of units between occurrences, where units can be in days, weeks, months, or years, depending on the type. Required.
      [Month <Int32?>]: The month in which the event occurs.  This is a number from 1 to 12.
      [Type <String>]: recurrencePatternType
    [Range <IMicrosoftGraphRecurrenceRange>]: recurrenceRange
      [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.

        [DayOfMonth <Int32?>]: The day of the month on which the event occurs. Required if type is absoluteMonthly or absoluteYearly.
        [DaysOfWeek <String[]>]: A collection of the days of the week on which the event occurs. The possible values are: sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday. If type is relativeMonthly or relativeYearly, and daysOfWeek specifies more than one day, the event falls on the first day that satisfies the pattern.  Required if type is weekly, relativeMonthly, or relativeYearly.
        [FirstDayOfWeek <String>]: dayOfWeek
        [Index <String>]: weekIndex
        [Interval <Int32?>]: The number of units between occurrences, where units can be in days, weeks, months, or years, depending on the type. Required.
        [Month <Int32?>]: The month in which the event occurs.  This is a number from 1 to 12.
        [Type <String>]: recurrencePatternType

COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

ACTIVITIES <IMicrosoftGraphUserActivity1[]>: The user's activities across devices. Read-only. Nullable.
  [Id <String>]: Read-only.
  [ActivationUrl <String>]: Required. URL used to launch the activity in the best native experience represented by the appId. Might launch a web-based app if no native app exists.
  [ActivitySourceHost <String>]: Required. URL for the domain representing the cross-platform identity mapping for the app. Mapping is stored either as a JSON file hosted on the domain or configurable via Windows Dev Center. The JSON file is named cross-platform-app-identifiers and is hosted at root of your HTTPS domain, either at the top level domain or include a sub domain. For example: https://contoso.com or https://myapp.contoso.com but NOT https://myapp.contoso.com/somepath. You must have a unique file and domain (or sub domain) per cross-platform app identity. For example, a separate file and domain is needed for Word vs. PowerPoint.
  [AppActivityId <String>]: Required. The unique activity ID in the context of the app - supplied by caller and immutable thereafter.
  [AppDisplayName <String>]: Optional. Short text description of the app used to generate the activity for use in cases when the app is not installed on the user’s local device.
  [ContentInfo <IMicrosoftGraphJson>]: Json
    [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
  [ContentUrl <String>]: Optional. Used in the event the content can be rendered outside of a native or web-based app experience (for example, a pointer to an item in an RSS feed).
  [CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]: Set by the server. DateTime in UTC when the object was created on the server.
  [ExpirationDateTime <DateTime?>]: Set by the server. DateTime in UTC when the object expired on the server.
  [FallbackUrl <String>]: Optional. URL used to launch the activity in a web-based app, if available.
  [HistoryItems <IMicrosoftGraphActivityHistoryItem1[]>]: Optional. NavigationProperty/Containment; navigation property to the activity's historyItems.
    [Id <String>]: Read-only.
    [ActiveDurationSeconds <Int32?>]: Optional. The duration of active user engagement. if not supplied, this is calculated from the startedDateTime and lastActiveDateTime.
    [Activity <IMicrosoftGraphUserActivity1>]: userActivity
    [CreatedDateTime <DateTime?>]: Set by the server. DateTime in UTC when the object was created on the server.
    [ExpirationDateTime <DateTime?>]: Optional. UTC DateTime when the historyItem will undergo hard-delete. Can be set by the client.
    [LastActiveDateTime <DateTime?>]: Optional. UTC DateTime when the historyItem (activity session) was last understood as active or finished - if null, historyItem status should be Ongoing.
    [LastModifiedDateTime <DateTime?>]: Set by the server. DateTime in UTC when the object was modified on the server.
    [StartedDateTime <DateTime?>]: Required. UTC DateTime when the historyItem (activity session) was started. Required for timeline history.
    [Status <String>]: status
    [UserTimezone <String>]: Optional. The timezone in which the user's device used to generate the activity was located at activity creation time. Values supplied as Olson IDs in order to support cross-platform representation.
  [LastModifiedDateTime <DateTime?>]: Set by the server. DateTime in UTC when the object was modified on the server.
